## Introduction
This project is part of my internship program at Prodigy InfoTech and focuses on building a regression model for predicting house prices. The dataset includes various attributes of houses, and the goal is to leverage features such as living area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms to estimate the sale price.  

## Features and Dataset
The dataset contains 81 features, including:
- **GrLivArea**: Above-grade living area (in square feet).
- **Bedroom**: Number of bedrooms above grade.
- **FullBath**: Number of full bathrooms above grade.

The target variable is **SalePrice**, representing the sale price of houses.
